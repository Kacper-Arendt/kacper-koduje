                    Iâ€™m 25 years old, and a third-year student of engineering studies in the field of logistics. I have
                    been programming for over a year. With the help of many online courses, I have mastered the basics
                    of JavaScript and TypeScript. I started my programming adventure with HTML/CSS, Php and MySQL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After gaining sufficient knowledge, I started to create my own application under the wings of two
                    friendly developers. The opportunity to work in a team allows me to discover the latest
                    technologies. Understanding what I am doing wrong gives me an opportunity to improve the quality of
                    my code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming and the desire for self-improvement absorbed me to such an extent that I decided to
                    change my professional life. <b> I am looking for a job or internship as a junior front-end
                    developer.</b>
